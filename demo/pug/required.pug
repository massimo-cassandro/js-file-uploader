block intro
  p.
    Since a file can be loaded via #[em Drag &amp; Drop], it is not possible
    to use the native #[code required] attribute to check for  mandatory files.
  p.
    However, this check can be performed using the #[code data-has-values] attribute
    added dynamically to the #[code .fupl-wrapper] element.
  p.
    First, mark an uploader as #[em required] adding the relative attribute to the original
    #[code input[type=file]] element (you can also add the #[code data-required="true"]
    attribute to the main uploader container).
  p.
    Then, check for #[code data-has-values] (#[code true] or #[code false])
    on form submit.
    #[br]
    You can use the #[code src-utilities/check_required_uploader.js] script
    to quickly add a check function. The script is also located in the
    #[code dist/utilities] folder as ESM and UMD.
  p.
    Look for more info at
    #[a(href="https://github.com/massimo-cassandro/js-file-uploader#required-fields-checking") Recipes: required Uploader]
    in the README page.
  p.
    To test the script, submit the form without the required image.
